/** \page scripting_matrix_type Matrix data type used for scripting
 *
 *   The matrix type Matrix4x4 is used in the scripting language to handle matrix operations.
 *   The implementation of the type for scripting can be found in prototypeMatrix4x4 .
 *
 *   You can use the following functions:
 *   \code
 *   var matrix = Matrix4x4(1,0,0,1,
 *                          0,1,0,2,
 *                          0,0,1,3,
 *                          0,0,0,1 )  // Create a matrix that contains only a translation (1,2,3).
 *
 *   var vec = Vector(1,2,3)  // Create a vector
 *
 *   var vec2 = matrix.transform_point(vec);  // Transforms a point by the given matrix (translation is included)
 *   var vec3 = matrix.transform_vector(vec); // Transforms a vector by the given matrix (translation is omitted)
 *
 *   \endcode
 *
